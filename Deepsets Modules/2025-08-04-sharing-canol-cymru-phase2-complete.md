## üîÑ **Current Project State**

### **What's Working** ‚úÖ
- **Phase 1 Platform**: All core functionality verified working on live site (https://sharing.canol.cymru/)
- **User Authentication**: Login/logout with session management (verified: member 108 Alexis R)
- **Item Management**: Full CRUD operations with community visibility controls
- **Community System**: Private groups and postcode-based communities functioning
- **Search Interface**: Enhanced with owner information and integrated booking buttons

### **Active Issues** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **No critical blockers** - Phase 2 code is complete and ready for deployment
- **Security**: SQL injection protection and password hashing deferred (Priority 3 per user request)
- **Testing**: Phase 2 features need live environment testing after deployment
- **Email Configuration**: Production SMTP setup may be required for optimal delivery

### **Next Immediate Actions** üìã
1. **Deploy Phase 2**: Run `mysql -u username -p sharingcanol_stuff < schema_updates.sql` to migrate database
2. **Upload Files**: Deploy all new PHP files to production web server with proper permissions
3. **Configure Cron**: Set up `*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/sharing/cron_notifications.php` for automated notifications
4. **Test Workflow**: Complete end-to-end booking request ‚Üí approval ‚Üí notification cycle
5. **Monitor Performance**: Check notification delivery logs and database query performance

## üö® **Critical Information for Next Agent**

### **Context Dependencies**
- **Phase 1 Verified Working**: User testing confirmed all core functionality operational on live site
- **Database Schema**: Phase 2 requires schema_updates.sql migration before file deployment
- **Email Dependencies**: Notification system requires working PHP mail() or SMTP configuration
- **Cron Access**: Automated notifications depend on server cron job capability
- **Existing Code Patterns**: All new code follows established procedural PHP style for consistency

### **Testing Status**
- **Phase 1**: Fully tested and verified working in production environment
- **Phase 2**: Code complete but requires live environment testing after deployment
- **Integration Points**: Search interface and navigation enhancements ready
- **Database Migration**: Schema tested with proper foreign key constraints and indexes

### **Known Limitations**
- **Security**: Current implementation maintains existing security level (improvements deferred)
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Basic table-based layout needs CSS framework for mobile optimization
- **Email Delivery**: Basic PHP mail() implementation may need SMTP upgrade for production scale
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive for booking/notification workflows, minimal for legacy code
