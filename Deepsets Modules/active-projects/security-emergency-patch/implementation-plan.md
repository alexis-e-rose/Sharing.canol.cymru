### Dependencies
- **External Dependencies**: PDO PHP extension (already available)
- **Internal Dependencies**: Existing qq() function pattern, miscfunctions.inc architecture
- **Blockers**: None - can implement immediately

## 🏗️ Technical Design
### Architecture Overview
Implement secure database wrapper functions maintaining existing procedural code structure while eliminating vulnerabilities through prepared statements and password hashing.

### Components Affected
- **Files to Modify**: 
  - `includes/miscfunctions.inc` (enhance qq() function)
  - All 15 PHP files with SQL injection vulnerabilities
  - All authentication files for password hashing
- **New Files to Create**:

### Technology Stack
- **Languages**: PHP 8.3+, SQL
- **Security**: PDO prepared statements, PHP password_hash()
- **Tools**: DPM for continuous security validation

### Security Considerations
- **Input Validation**: All user input passed through prepared statements

- [ ] Remaining files: add_listing.php (13), my_bookings.php (6), others
- [ ] Complete DPM validation 
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: 🔄 CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES ADDRESSED - Core security implemented

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
### Unit Testing

### User Acceptance Testing
- [ ] Existing user login with updated password security
- [ ] All major user workflows (search, booking, notifications)

### Security Testing
- [ ] SQL injection attempt validation
- [ ] Password security verification
- [ ] DPM security scan verification

## 🚨 Risk Assessment
### High Risk Items
- **Risk**: Breaking existing user authentication during password migration
  **Impact**: HIGH
  **Probability**: MEDIUM

## 📝 Decision Log
### [2025-08-04] - Prepared Statements Implementation Strategy
**Context**: 112 SQL injection vulnerabilities need immediate remediation without breaking existing code
**Options Considered**: 
  1. Complete rewrite to PDO/ORM framework
  2. Enhanced qq() function with prepared statements maintaining compatibility  
  3. Input sanitization only (mysqli_real_escape_string)
**Decision**: Enhanced qq() function with prepared statements for backward compatibility
**Impact**: Maintains existing procedural architecture while eliminating SQL injection risks

### [2025-08-04] - Password Hashing Approach
**Context**: Plain text password storage across authentication system  
**Options Considered**: bcrypt, Argon2, PHP password_hash() with default
**Decision**: PHP password_hash() with PASSWORD_DEFAULT for future algorithm flexibility
**Impact**: Slight performance impact but critical security improvement with future-proofing

## 🎯 Post-Implementation Review (Phase 1-2 Complete)
### What Went Well ✅
- **RAD Protocol Effectiveness**: Fast implementation with immediate security improvements
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained existing functionality while adding security
- **Comprehensive Security Framework**: Created reusable security functions for entire application
- **Critical Path Focus**: Prioritized authentication and core vulnerabilities first

### What Could Be Improved ⚠️
- **DPM Tool Limitations**: Static analysis can't distinguish secure function calls from vulnerabilities
- **Remaining Vulnerabilities**: Still need to address non-critical files (add_listing.php, etc.)
- **Testing Requirements**: Need functional testing of authentication flows

### Lessons Learned 📚
- **Security-First Development**: Prepared statements and password hashing are non-negotiable
- **Incremental Security**: Can implement security improvements without breaking existing functionality
- **Tool Limitations**: Static analysis tools require human validation for modern security patterns

### Knowledge Base Updates
- [ ] SQL injection prevention patterns for procedural PHP
- [ ] Password security migration techniques
- [ ] Emergency security patching workflows
