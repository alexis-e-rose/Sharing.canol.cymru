  CREATE TABLE notifications (
      notification_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      member_id INT NOT NULL,
      notification_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      message TEXT NOT NULL,
      is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
      created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

      FOREIGN KEY (member_id) REFERENCES members(member_ID) ON DELETE CASCADE
  );
  
  -- Create booking-related tables
  CREATE TABLE bookings (
      booking_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      thing_id INT NOT NULL,
      borrower_id INT NOT NULL,
      owner_id INT NOT NULL,
      start_date DATE NOT NULL,
