Registering and logging in
    1. Allow users to register for an account. They will need to submit 
    • first name
    • last name
    • email address
    • mobile phone number
    • postal address
    • postcode
    • preferred method of contact (email, text or whatsapp)
    2. In this document, the term “user” is used to mean anyone that has registered and created an account.
Membership of communities
    3. Users are grouped into communities. There are two different types of community that can be defined, they can be either a “geographic community” and “community of friends”.
    4. The term “member” is used to refer to a user that belongs to one or more of the defined communities. 
    5. When a new user registers, by default they are not allocated to any communities. 
    6. A “geographic community”  is a community defined by postcode. Users can become members of this community by having a postcode that matches the one or more postcodes that define the community. Use of wildcards for partial matches. 
    7. Each geographic community must have one or more designated adminstrators
    8. If a registered user has a matching password they can apply to join a “geographic community”. The application must be approved by one of the designated administrators, to prevent users registering with the website and entering a false postcode to join groups that they are not eligible for.
    9. Any user can create a “community of friends” by setting a name for this community and a password. This person can then invite other users by giving them the community name and password and their email address. Anyone registered on the website can join this “community of friends” by submitting the community name, password, and email address of the person that created the community. (the email address and password forms the unique identification).
    10. Each user can be a member of any number of communities but must be a member of at least one geographic community. If they join more than one geographic community, they most choose which one to designate as their “lead community”. The lead community is then the one that their community donation is paid to.
Listing items for sale and loan
    11. Once a member has created an account they can list items for sale or for loan. 
    12. The item can be defined by entering 
    • Title (make, model)
    • main description (including condition)
    • Price
    • Percent of price to be donated to a community fund
    • number of identical items available (e.g. if selling tomato plants)
    • tagged as “for sale” or “for loan”. 
    • They can also upload one image of the item.
    13. When listing an item for loan the lender can specify two prices, a price for the first day of loan, and a price for additional days. 
    14. Users can list items either for a price, or free. 
The community fund
    15. For each item, whether for sale or loan, the user selects the proportion of the price or fee they donate to a community fund, and the proportion for them to keep themselves. There are only 3 options, to donate 100%, to donate 50%, or to donate 20% to the community fund.
    16. Users are encouraged to set a non-zero price and to donate 100% to the community fund.
    17. There will be an insurance scheme that will apply to items for loan. It will be made clear that where no loan fee is requested (i.e., price of zero), that the insurance does not apply and if the item is damaged or lost, the lender will receive no compensation. 
    18. The administrators of each “geographic community” can list one or more community causes that community fund can be donated to. 
    19. When a user is setting the proportion of the fee to go to a community fund, they are presented with a drop down list of community causes and asked which they wish their contribution to be donated to.
    20. The website keeps a tally of each item sold or loaned, the price or fee, the seller or lender, and the cause being donated to. 
    21. When the cumulative amount from all completed transactions each seller or lender has offered to donate reaches a given threshold (say £20), the user is sent a statement of their transactions and asked to make a payment to the designated administrator of their lead community. The designated administrator will arrange for this to be passed on to the fund recipient.
    22. The administrators of this lead community keep a tally of payments from members and enter these into the software to reconcile against transactions so that it is clear at any point what remaining sum is due from each lender/seller.
Listing and searching for items
    23. Once a user has uploaded details of an item to be sold/lent, the user can decide for which of the communities they belong to that they wish the item to be visible to. Particularly for items for loan, they may decide an item will only be visible to people within their “community of friends” and not with any users within their “geographic” communities.
    24. Any registered user can search listings uploaded by other users. Their search results will only contain items that have been defined as visible to one or any of the communities that the user doing the search is a member of.
Reserving and confirming sales
    25. For items listed for sale, if a user sees an item that they are interested in buying, they can click to reserve this item. Once this has happened, the user will have access to the preferred contact method of the seller. The item will remain “reserved” until either the seller marks it as sold, or if the transaction does not proceed, the seller can remove the “reserved” tag. 
    26. If the seller and buyer agree the sale, the seller marks the items as “sold”. It is no longer made visible in searches.
    27. If the “sold for” price is different from the advertised price, the seller can modify the price and create a “sold for” price. The database records the “sold for” price in addition to the original “advertised” price.
    28. While it is “reserved” other users cannot themselves reserve it but can see it listed and tagged as “reserved”. 
    29. If an item for sale was listed as having multiple units, the user can reserve more than one of these. If this is less than the total available, the item remains available for other users (For instance, someone could sell tomato plants via the site, and grow many for sale)
Reserving and confirming loans
    30. For items listed for loan, once a member has “reserved” the item, this does not prevent other members reserving the item for themselves. 
    31. Clicking “reserve” will enable the potential borrower to see the preferred contact details of the lender so that the potential lender and borrower can discuss the transaction. 
    32. Once a transaction is agreed between them, the lender clicks to confirm the transaction for a specified number of days.  
    33. If the transaction does not proceed, the lender can cancel the reservation. 
Making payment
    34. Payments are not processed at all via the website. Transactions are expected to be carried out in person, as this is a local service so it is not expected that postal or carriage services will be used.
    35. Payments will be made in cash when an item is collected/delivered. This payment will include both the community fund element and the sellers element. 
    36. Sellers/lenders are expected to transfer the amounts promised to the community fund when requested by the appropriate designated administrators of the community. This can be handed over by whatever method is preferred by the administrator and user, whether cash, cheque or bank transfer. It is expected that bank transfer will be preferred by most administrators.
    37. If a user does not hand over any amounts promised to the community fund, the administrators can freeze that users account so that they can no longer see items visible in that community.
