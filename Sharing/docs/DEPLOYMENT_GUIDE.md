# Phase 2 Feature Deployment Guide
**Calendar Booking System & Notification System**

## ðŸ“‹ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Backup Your Current System
```bash
# Backup database
mysqldump -u username -p sharingcanol_stuff > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Backup files
cp -r Sharing/ Sharing_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)/
```

### 2. Test Environment Setup
- Deploy to staging/test environment first
- Verify all existing functionality still works
- Test new features with sample data

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Database Schema Updates
```bash
# Run the schema update script
mysql -u username -p sharingcanol_stuff < schema_updates.sql
```

**Verify tables created:**
- `bookings` - booking requests and scheduling
- `notifications` - notification queue
- `notification_templates` - email templates
- New columns added to `things` and `members` tables

### Step 2: Deploy New PHP Files
Upload these new files to your web server:
```
Sharing/
â”œâ”€â”€ includes/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ booking_functions.inc          # NEW
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ notification_functions.inc     # NEW
â”œâ”€â”€ my_bookings.php                    # NEW
â”œâ”€â”€ request_booking.php                # NEW
â”œâ”€â”€ notifications.php                  # NEW
â””â”€â”€ cron_notifications.php             # NEW
```

### Step 3: Update Existing Files
These files have been modified:
- `includes/header.inc` - added new navigation links
- `search.php` - added booking functionality
- Page titles and includes updated

### Step 4: Set File Permissions
```bash
chmod 644 *.php
chmod 644 includes/*.inc
chmod 755 cron_notifications.php  # Make executable for cron
```

### Step 5: Configure Cron Job
Add to your crontab to process notifications every 15 minutes:
```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line (adjust path as needed)
*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/sharing/cron_notifications.php >> /var/log/sharing_notifications.log 2>&1
```

### Step 6: Email Configuration
Ensure PHP mail() function is configured on your server:
- SMTP settings in php.ini
- Or configure PHPMailer for better email delivery (future enhancement)

## ðŸ§ª Testing Procedures

### 1. Test Basic Functionality
- [ ] Login/logout still works
- [ ] Item listing still works
- [ ] Search still works
- [ ] Private groups still work

### 2. Test New Features

#### Booking System:
- [ ] Navigate to Search â†’ find a loan item â†’ click "Book Item"
- [ ] Fill out booking request form
- [ ] Owner receives notification
- [ ] Owner can approve/decline in "My Bookings"
- [ ] Borrower sees status updates

#### Notification System:
- [ ] Check "Notifications" page shows test notifications
- [ ] Verify email notifications are sent (check cron log)
- [ ] Test notification preferences
- [ ] Verify unread count appears in header

### 3. Test Calendar Functionality
- [ ] Date selection works in booking form
- [ ] Cost calculation updates automatically
- [ ] Availability checking prevents double-booking
- [ ] Due date reminders are generated

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Maintenance

### 1. Monitor Cron Job
```bash
# Check notification processing log
tail -f /var/log/sharing_notifications.log

# Check for failed notifications
SELECT * FROM notifications WHERE notification_status = 3;
```

### 2. Database Maintenance
```sql
-- Check booking statistics
SELECT booking_status, COUNT(*) FROM bookings GROUP BY booking_status;

-- Check notification delivery rates
SELECT notification_status, COUNT(*) FROM notifications GROUP BY notification_status;

-- Clean up old read notifications (older than 30 days)
DELETE FROM notifications 
WHERE notification_status = 4 
AND notification_read < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Monitor database size growth
- Check email delivery rates
- Monitor cron job execution time

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Notifications not sending**
   - Check PHP mail() configuration
   - Verify cron job is running
   - Check notification table for failed status

2. **Booking conflicts**
   - Verify date validation logic
   - Check timezone settings
   - Test availability checking function

3. **Missing navigation links**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Verify header.inc was updated correctly
   - Check include paths

### Database Issues:
```sql
-- Reset a stuck booking
UPDATE bookings SET booking_status = 5 WHERE booking_ID = ?;

-- Resend failed notification
UPDATE notifications SET notification_status = 1, notification_attempts = 0 WHERE notification_ID = ?;
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **User Training**
   - Create user guide for booking system
   - Explain notification preferences
   - Demo calendar functionality

2. **Feature Enhancements**

# Restore files
rm -rf Sharing/
