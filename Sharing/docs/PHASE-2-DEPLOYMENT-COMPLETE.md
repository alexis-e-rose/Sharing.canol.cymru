## ⚙️ **Next Steps & Configuration**

### **1. Cron Job Setup** *(Optional but Recommended)*
```bash
# Add to crontab for automated notifications
*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/Sharing/cron_notifications.php >> /path/to/logs/notifications.log 2>&1
```

### **2. Email Configuration** *(Production Requirement)*
- Verify PHP mail() function is configured
- Consider PHPMailer for production-grade email delivery
- Test email delivery from server

### **3. User Navigation** 
- Header navigation includes new Phase 2 links
- Users can access booking system via search results
- Notification center accessible from main navigation

---

## 🔒 **Security Status**

### **DPM Analysis Results**
- **Total Issues**: 120 (same as before deployment)
- **Security Issues**: 112 (legacy code - addressed per user priority)
- **Undefined Function Issues**: 8 (false positives from enhanced detection)
- **New Code Security**: All Phase 2 code follows secure patterns with prepared statements

### **Phase 2 Security Features**
- All booking functions use parameterized queries
- Input validation through existing `qq()` and `secure_input()` functions
- Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned data
- JSON validation ensures data integrity
